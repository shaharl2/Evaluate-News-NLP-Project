# Evaluate News NLP Project

## Project Description

In this project I built a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

The app creates a call to the MeaningCloud API and the returned information from the api response is dispalyed in the UI view
